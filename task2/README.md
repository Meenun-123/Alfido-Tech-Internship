# Task 2 – Tailwind Responsive Navbar

This project is a responsive navigation bar built using **HTML**, **TailwindCSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
It is created as part of the Alfido Tech Frontend Development Internship – Task 2.

The navbar automatically adapts to different screen sizes and includes a hamburger menu for mobile devices.

## 🚀 Features

- Fully responsive navigation bar  
- Built using TailwindCSS CDN  
- Clean and modern dark UI  
- Hamburger menu for mobile screens  
- Smooth animation effects  
- Mobile menu slides open and closes with animation  
- No external CSS file required


## 🧩 Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **TailwindCSS**
- **JavaScript**

## 📱 How It Works

- On large screens, navigation links appear in a horizontal layout.
- On smaller screens, the links are hidden and replaced by a hamburger button.
- Clicking the hamburger icon toggles the mobile menu with animation.

## 📦 How to Run

1. Download or clone the repository  
2. Open `index.html` in any web browser  
3. The Tailwind CDN loads automatically  
4. The navbar will display responsively based on your device size
